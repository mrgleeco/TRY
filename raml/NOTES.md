cool stuff from RAML world -- [docs](http://raml.org/docs.html)

nice slick editor at [apiDesigner](https://github.com/ericbirdsall/apiDesigner)
(must modify to get it to store somewhere cool; eg. localStorage for now, but want gists or FS under git rev control)

more complete work via mulseoft at [api-notebook](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-notebook.git)

demo here is parsed output created apiDesigner in spec/*.raml; run
    
    gulp raml

..which runs the gulpfile.js
